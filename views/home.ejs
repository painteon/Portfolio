      <h5 class="mini-title">Greetings</h5>
      <p>Hello. My name is Bobby Imakavar, I am a Full-Stack web developer. I am familiar with both Front-End and Back-End technologies, however I specialize primarily in Front-End development.</p>
      <h5 class="mini-title">Starting Point</h5>
      <p>I began my journey in web development on January of 2020 by purchasing an online course on <span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy</a></span> and spending the next 6-7 months learning
        everything the course had to offer. After the initial learning period, I spent the remainder of my time building my own websites.</p>
      <h5 class="mini-title">History</h5>
      <p>Prior to 2020, I was a recent college graduate with my bachelors of science in Biology. My original plan was to enter the medical field; however, after 2 years of working as an EMT and preparing for medical school, I found out that I did not enjoy it as much as I had believed. Up until that point in time, I had always admired having a career  in programming and technology, but I did not pursue it any further. Following that interest, I took a chance on an intro to programming course that utilized python and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Ever since then, I wanted to delve deeper into programming, but I felt pressured into making a career out of my Biology degree due to the four year university commitment. Not to mention, the monetary roadblock erected by thoughts of going to school for another degree. This was my thought process, until I realized that there was another way for me to enter software development without investing more years and money into schooling. I found Udemy by chance, explored its catalog of programming courses and took the leap into becoming a self taught software engineer. I haven't regretted making that decision. </p>
